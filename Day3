🚀 Today’s Learning Highlights – Kubernetes + Docker + Node.js
I focused on both theoretical and practical concepts and completed hands-on work across Docker, Kubernetes, and VS Code.
🔹 Kubernetes Workflow Practiced
1️⃣ Create Cluster – Using minikube start / cloud-based Kubernetes
2️⃣ Deploy Application – kubectl create deployment
3️⃣ Explore Application – kubectl get pods, kubectl logs, kubectl exec
4️⃣ Expose Application – kubectl expose deployment
5️⃣ Scale Application – kubectl scale deployment
6️⃣ Update Application – kubectl set image + rollout commands
🔹 Docker + Node.js Work
Built a Node.js application and wrote a complete Dockerfile in VS Code
Successfully containerized and deployed the app
Next step: integrating the containerized app with Kubernetes for end-to-end orchestration
Excited to continue building real-world DevOps skills and improving my Kubernetes workflow every day! 🚀🐳☸️
