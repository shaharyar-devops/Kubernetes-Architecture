Today I learn many things about Kubernetes node port

I created :
1: Deploymnet.yml file
2: Service.yml file 
3: Dockerfile

From Docker file we created an image and named it 
Second build the image and deployed it using Deployment.yml file 
Third I used Node Port service because I want my internal enviornmnet to talk to the minikube Node (Service Discovery)
One more important thing is that we should always tag the image 

After the setup Now I have the access of the minikube maschine from my external browser using the node port .
